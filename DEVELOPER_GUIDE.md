# This is the Developer Guide.

Coming soon!

## TO DO: (and PR's are welcome)

- re-work command line options for POSIX style
- re-name all *ftw_* prefixes to *vacuumms_* 
- re-name uniq to something without a name collision, e.g. vuniq
- display build options as output when running vacuumms executable

## Developer stuff

**apocrypha** - projects that are not yet complete, have not yet been ported or documented, or which have been replaced by a refactored version

**ftw_examples** - sample codes for developers showcasing some of the design patterns employed in VACUUMMS
