As of today, 12 April 2004 

I am proclaiming my infrastructure as follows for the random number generator:

setCommandLineParameters(argc, argv);
if (getFlagParam("-randomize")) randomize();
else initializeRandomNumberGenerator();

additional command line options can be grabbed with 
double getDoubleParam("-whatever");
int getIntParam("-int_param");

don't forget 
#include <ftw_param.h>
#include <ftw_rng.h>
and 
#include <ftw_std.h> (I think...)


I'm not going to go back and fix everything else, but what I write from here on out will be this way because it's what works.
