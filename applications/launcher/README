-------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI Batch Launcher: a simple utility for submitting multiple 
                    serial applications simultaneously. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use:

  Edit the supplied Makefile to identify the correct Fortran (FC) and C
  compilers (CC) and make any necessary compiler flag modifications
  prior to building the launcher executable.  After running make, edit
  the "paramlist" file to supply the name of each serial application to
  run per MPI process (these can be the same for each process, but there
  needs to be a separate line specified for each desired MPI process).
  Note that there is an example paramlist file provided which is setup
  to run 8 instances of the program named "hello"; the stdin
  for this application is a single integer. Source code in Fortran is
  provided for the hello world application which can be used to test the batch
  launcher.

  Note: you can also use the MPI launcher to run a sequence of serial
  jobs when you have more jobs to run than the requested number of
  processors.  In this case, you must also provide an additional
  command-line argument to the launcher detailing the total number of
  jobs to execute (scroll to the end of the example launcher.lsf script
  for more information).
  
Job Submission:

  Use the example job submission scripts provided as a starting point
  for interfacing with your batch system (example scripts are
  provided for pbs, poe, and lsf).

  Note that these scripts provide some simple error checking prior
  to the actual submission to aid in diagnosing missing executables and
  the like.

  Edit the example script to reflect the desired number of processes and
  submit the job as follows:

	PBS: qsub launcher.pbs
	POE: llsubmit launcher.poe
	LSF: bsub < launcher.lsf
