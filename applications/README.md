# VACUUMMS Applications 


## Developer stuff

**archive** - projects that are not yet complete, have not yet been ported or documented, or which have been replaced by a refactored version

**ftw_examples** - sample codes for developers showcasing some of the design patterns employed in VACUUMMS

## Working applications

#### **2pc**

Two-point correlation code. 

IN: list of x,y,z positions, box dims specified at CL.
OUT: Tabulated radial distribution function.

### **center**

Takes as input a clustered set of cavities and shifts it around until it's no longer hanging out of the simulation box.
Program does not perform validation check (all cavities are one cluster) only makes sure that no cavity pair straddles a boundary.

IN:  .cav
OUT: .cav
