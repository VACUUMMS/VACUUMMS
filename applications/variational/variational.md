# VACUUMMS variational module

The variational module is an extesion to VACUUMMS that allows for finding the paths of least energy along the insertion energy landscape. Taking the set of pairs of Voronoi vertices (in lieu of CESA cavity centers, which are nearly identical but which lack the implicit pairing of Voronoi edges) as input. The following protocol is applied for each edge:

The
